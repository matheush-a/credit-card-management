# CreditCardManager

In order to make application work at it's best, it is fundamental to install locally the following:

Composer: [Composer's official webpage](https://getcomposer.org/download/)

Laravel: [Laravel's official webpage](https://laravel.com/docs/9.x/installation)

MySQL: [MySQL's official webpage](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-installation-excerpt/8.0/en/general-installation-issues.html)


After downloading and extracting this project, you must run 'composer install' for dependencies installation.

You must log-in with your MySQL user and password and create a database for this project, after that you need to configure this project's environment file (.env).

Subsequently, you must run the preset migrations and after you should run the preset seeders in order to populate some tables at the database.

Command for running migrations: php artisan migrate
Command for running seeders: php artisan db:seed

IMPORTANT
You should access Credit Card API

There's an available Postman's environment with all the necessary endpoints for this application: [Credit Card workspace](https://app.getpostman.com/join-team?invite_code=26e49ce5df57174fc470524587a3d182&target_code=a9f10dc5fbec678d5488e809eeab1147)
